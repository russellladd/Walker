# Walker

Walked is a sample app that manages a log of a user's walks. It was used in the Michigan Hackers Tech Talk Modern iOS Development on March 30, 2015. Design, application architecture, view controllers, collection views, layer-backed views, delegation, Core Data, and Core Motion were all used in the app and covered in some level of detail during the talk.

The attached slides also include a tour of other native iOS frameworks and technologies.
