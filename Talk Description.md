## Modern iOS Development

iOS is the best mobile software platform available, both for users and for developers. Come and learn the latest best practices as we build a basic app in Swift with a heavy emphasis on understanding the Model-View-Controller application architecture. We will also take an extensive tour of the many advanced native technologies available on the platform, so you can get an idea of how powerful the applications you write can be.

Minimum recommendation for attendance is to be currently enrolled in EECS 280 with no outside of class experience. However, we do expect to have something for even rather experienced iOS developers!
